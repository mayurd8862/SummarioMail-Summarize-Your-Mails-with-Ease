[Upcoming Event on 2.22] Turbocharge Your RAG Applications with Powerful RAG Analytics
Join in on our workshop to learn about RAG Applications and how to maximize RAG Analytics
Dear Mayur,
In case you missed it, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) has emerged as a leading approach in developing generative AI applications. However, building error-free RAG systems comes with significant challenges, including maintaining chunk and document quality, refining prompts, and addressing output hallucinations.
In this session, we'll distill our learnings from conversations with hundreds of AI teams utilizing RAG. Our focus will include:
Overcoming the 5 major roadblocks in RAG application development
Effective strategies for mitigating these 5 challenges
Introducing 4 robust evaluation metrics to identify and rectify issues in your RAG system
How to build production-ready RAG-powered applications 10x faster
Can't attend live? Don't worry. For anyone registered, we will be sending out the recorded sessions afterward.
Don't miss out! Tune in at 10AM PST on Thursday, February 22nd
